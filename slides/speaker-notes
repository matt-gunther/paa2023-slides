# About 

My name is Matt Gunther, and I'm a senior data analyst at IPUMS PMA. 

IPUMS provides harmonized census and survey data from around that world, which means that you can get integrated data files covering multiple samples collected over time or in different places. 

At IPUMS PMA, we harmonize surveys from the PMA data series. PMA collects high frequency, longitudinal surveys focused on reproductive health in several countries. We offer it for free - come talk to us!  

My role is largely showcase PMA data on our blog, and sometimes I get to help affiliated researchers like Kat and Jiao. In this project, we're using data from a 2020 PMA Ethiopia survey to examine the impact of climate change (heat expsoure) on pregnancy outcomes.
